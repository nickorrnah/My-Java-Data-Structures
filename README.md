# My-Java-Data-Structures
Recreations of various Java data structures and their functionalities.

## About this Repository
This repository holds files that recreate various Java data structures and their functionalities.  Additionally, some other files are included that read in, parse, and encode the entirety of Leo Tolstoy's "War and Peace".

These files were initially created for school projects and were written by myself.

## Why is this repository here?
The sole goal of this repository is to showcase my code writing style and techniques.  Most of these files will not work by simply forking the repository and will require additional work to get running on your machine.  

## DO NOT plagiarize this code for your classes!
In the unlikely circumstance that this repository be happened upon by a student, you do not have my consent to copy this code and turn it in as your own.  

To all other parties, I highly encourage using Java's built-in versions of these functions over my own.
